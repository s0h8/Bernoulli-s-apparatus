##Procedure

1.	Note down the piezometers distance from inlet section of the Perspex duct.
2.	Note down the cross-sectional area of Perspex duct at each of the piezpmeter tapping points.
3.	The datum head is treated as constant through out the duct.
4.	By maintaining suitable amount of steady head or near by steady head conditions in the supply tanks there establish a steady non-uniform flow in the conduit.
5.	The discharge flowing in the conduit is recorded together with the water levels in each piezometer tubes.
6.	This procedure is repeated for other value of discharge.
