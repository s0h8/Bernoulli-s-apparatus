<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : to provide students hands on practice on physical processes and theoretical concepts made practical for their better understanding. </h5>

The Fluid Mechanics laboratory is designed to examine the properties of fluids and to conduct experiments involving both incompressible and compressible flow.Facilities for investigating the fundamentals of fluid statics, kinematics, kinetics of fluid flow, open channel flow and  centrifugal pumps should be available in the labs.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

By this experiment we want students to understand the concep t of mechanical energy balance existing in the fluid flows. By doing this experiment they would themselves analyze that if the value of one form of energy is reduced by any means then the value for other form increases. And this is always true for ideal fluid for different flow rates.

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

UG AND PG students of chemical engineering.

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>

The listed course goals can be e achieved only when certain learning objective are defined and to know the outcome for that the learning objective are attained by students we need some assessments by which we would know that how how much accomplishment it is achieved.

Here based on the course goals learning objectives are finalized. These are the points which the student should learn before and during the the commencement of of the lab so that he she maybe well equipped with the basic theory of theory and laws. To judge whether the student has completely understood the process various questions are set on each learning objective. The scores attained will provide the basis to judge that in what part of the process student it still needs learning.
